### UML Communication Diagrams

UML communication diagrams, similar to sequence diagrams, are a type of interaction diagram that illustrates how objects communicate. Essentially, they build upon object diagrams by not only showing the objects but also the messages exchanged between them. Alongside object associations, communication diagrams depict the flow of messages between objects, highlighting their interactions.
